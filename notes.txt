Pages:
    - Main page shows options to enter Last.fm username, and potentially displays a collection of other users'
    visualizations. Clicking to enter your Last.fm username will open a modal to enter with a prompt, text box,
    and submit button. User can also click to login or register.
    ('')

    - Stats loading page will display a loading animation while the user's statistics are being fetched from Last.fm.
    ('stats/loading/<str:username>/')

    - Next is user statistics page which will potentially display various statistics from user's Last.fm account data,
    and also shows a button to create a visualization.
    ('stats/<str:username>/')

    - Visualization options page will show a list of visualization options to choose from as well as several filter
    options and a submit button.
    ('visualization/options/<str:username>/')

    - Visualization loading page will display a loading animation while the visualization is being generated.
    ('visualization/loading/<int:visualization_id>/')

    - Visualization page will display the visualization based on the options chosen as well as options to download the
    visualization as an image.
    ('visualization/result/<int:visualization_id>/')

    - User account page will display saved or generated visualizations.
    ('account/')

    - About/Help/Privacy policy page will be linked at the bottom of each page and displays information about what the
    app does, how data is fetched, privacy policy, and help documentation.
    ('about/')


Tables:
    UserProfile
    - id (auto)
    - lastfm_username (string, unique)
    - display_name (string)
    - profile_url (string)
    - avatar_url (string)
    - total_scrobbles (integer)
    - registered_date (date)
    - top_artists (JSONField)
    - top_albums (JSONField)
    - top_tracks (JSONField)
    - recent_tracks (JSONField)
    - last_updated (datetime - when user data was last fetched)

    Visualization
    - id (auto)
    - user_id (integer, foreign key)
    - vizualization_type (string)
    - filters (JSONField)
    - image_file (FileField or ImageField)
    - created_at (datetime)

If user loads user statistics page and the UserProfile.last_updated is more than 1 hour ago, fetch new data from Last.fm.

For registration/login, use Django's built-in login system for site accounts, which store a default last.fm username.
Logged in users can save visualizations they generate, return to a "My Visualizations" page, delete them, or maybe even
favorite other users' visualizations.

Will need to create register view, and login and register templates.

Remember to remove static js script tags from templates if not using them

Consider making a page for privacy policy and a page for help, if not, then remove from base.html footer.
