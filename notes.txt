Pages:
    - Main page shows options to enter Last.fm username, and potentially displays a collection of other users'
    visualizations. Clicking to enter your Last.fm username will open a modal to enter with a prompt, text box,
    and submit button.
    - Next is user statistics page which will potentially display various statistics from user's Last.fm account data,
    and also shows a button to create a visualization.
    - Visualization options page will show a list of visualization options to choose from as well as several filter
    options and a submit button.
    - Visualization page will display the visualization based on the options chosen as well as options to download the
    visualization as an image.
    - About/Help/Privacy policy page will be linked at the bottom of each page and displays information about what the
    app does, how data is fetched, privacy policy, and help documentation.

Tables:
    UserProfile
    - id (auto)
    - lastfm_username (string, unique)
    - display_name (string)
    - profile_url (string)
    - avatar_url (string)
    - total_scrobbles (integer)
    - registered_date (date)
    - top_artists (JSONField)
    - top_albums (JSONField)
    - top_tracks (JSONField)
    - recent_tracks (JSONField)
    - last_updated (datetime - when user data was last fetched)

    Visualization

    - vizualization_type (string)
    - filters (JSONField)
    - image_file (FileField or ImageField)
    - created_at (datetime)

If user loads user statistics page and the UserProfile.last_updated is more than 1 hour ago, fetch new data from Last.fm.

For registration/login, use Django's built-in login system for site accounts, which store a default last.fm username.
Logged in users can save visualizations they generate, return to a "My Visualizations" page, delete them, or maybe even
favorite other users' visualizations.
