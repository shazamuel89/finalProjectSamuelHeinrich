Pages:
    - Main page shows options to enter Last.fm username, and potentially displays a collection of other users'
    visualizations. Clicking to enter your Last.fm username will open a modal to enter with a prompt, text box,
    and submit button. User can also click to login or register.
    ('')

    - Stats loading page will display a loading animation while the user's statistics are being fetched from Last.fm.
    ('stats/loading/<str:username>/')

    - Next is user statistics page which will potentially display various simple statistics from user's Last.fm account data,
    and also shows a button to create a visualization.
    ('stats/<str:username>/')

    - Visualization options page will show a list of visualization options to choose from as well as several filter
    options and a submit button.
    ('visualization/options/<str:username>/')
    Options will be:
        - Streamgraph by artist
        - Streamgraph by album
        - Streamgraph by track
        - Streamgraph by genre
        Filters will be:
        - Time period (last 7 days, last 30 days, last 6 months, all time)
        - Top # of items in the graph
        OPTIONAL TO IMPLEMENT:
        - Amount of smoothing (sd)
        - Normalization options (Percentage produces cleaner streamgraphs)
        - Sorting order of items (descending, ascending, random looks best)
        - Color theme
        -

    - Visualization loading page will display a loading animation while the visualization is being generated.
    ('visualization/loading/<int:visualization_id>/')

    - Visualization page will display the visualization based on the options chosen as well as options to download the
    visualization as an image.
    ('visualization/result/<int:visualization_id>/')

    - User account page will display saved or generated visualizations.
    ('account/')

    - About/Help/Privacy policy page will be linked at the bottom of each page and displays information about what the
    app does, how data is fetched, privacy policy, and help documentation.
    ('about/')


Tables:
    SiteUserProfile (extension of Django's built-in user account.)
    - id (AutoField, primary key)
    - user (OneToOneField to auth.User, required, cascades on delete)
    - default_lastfm_username (CharField, max_length=100, nullable/optional)

    LastfmUserProfile
    - id (AutoField, primary key)

    - display_name (CharField, max_length=100, nullable/optional)
    - profile_url (URLField, nullable/optional)
    - avatar_url (URLField, nullable/optional)
    - registered_date (DateField, nullable/optional)

    Visualization
    - id (AutoField, primary key)
    - owner (ForeignKey to auth.User, nullable/optional, sets to NULL if user is deleted)
    - lastfm_user (ForeignKey to LastfmUserProfile, required, cascades on delete)
    - visualization_type (CharField, max_length=100)
    - filters (JSONField, default {}, nullable/optional)
    - favorites (ManyToManyField to auth.User, optional)
    - image_file (FileField, saved under visualizations/)
    - created_at (DateTimeField, auto_now_add=True)


If user is not logged in, they can still generate visualizations and do everything else, except save those visualizations
into their account. The visualizations will be saved in the database, but will have no owner.

Add favorited visualizations functionality or remove it entirely.

Set up Django admin and style models for proper entry.

Remove loading templates if they don't get used.

README.md instructions must include:
        - python manage.py makemigrations
        - python manage.py migrate
        - python manage.py createsuperuser

ADD MORE COMMENTS!!

Todo:
- Allow limiting number of entities in visualization.
- Make type, created, and filters used appear in visualization result page.
- Save owner if logged in when creating visualization.
- Fix entity list on graph








Ideas for loading screens:


🎧 1. Vertical “Sound Bars” Loading Animation (Stats Loading)

A loading animation inspired by the familiar look of an audio equalizer. It consists of several vertical bars arranged horizontally across the center of the screen. Each bar repeatedly grows and shrinks at slightly different speeds and heights, giving the impression of live audio reacting to a song.

The animation conveys the idea of "analyzing sound," which is perfect for fetching user listening data from Last.fm. The bars can be thin and minimalist or thick and more stylized depending on the design of the rest of the site. Colors can match your theme, or use a neon/gradient palette for a more energetic look.

This loading screen is easy to implement using simple HTML div elements styled as vertical rectangles, with a CSS animation that adjusts each bar’s height using keyframes. Randomized delays make each bar animate asynchronously, giving a natural equalizer effect.

Use for: Loading user statistics (fetching scrobbles, top artists, recent listens).
Vibe: Musical, dynamic, recognizable, playful.
Effort level: Easy.


🎶 2. Circular “Waveform Ring” / Pulsing Echo Animation (Stats Loading)

A circular pulse animation that visually mimics waves of sound expanding outward from a source. The design centers on a solid or outlined circle from which one or more rings radiate outward. As each ring expands, it gradually fades out, then restarts — creating a loop of smooth, soft “echo” ripples.

This design works beautifully with the theme of listening history because it resembles audio waves, sonar pings, or vibrations — symbolizing the system “echo-locating” your music data.

You can use a single ring for a minimalist look or multiple staggered rings for a more rhythmic effect. Colors could be monochromatic or use soft gradients for a modern aesthetic. The animation uses CSS keyframes to increase the ring size and decrease opacity simultaneously.

Use for: Loading user stats (Last.fm API requests).
Vibe: Calm, modern, clean audio-wave aesthetic.
Effort level: Medium.


🎨 3. Gradient “Shimmer Box” / Skeleton Loader (Visualization Loading)

A modern loading effect inspired by skeleton loaders used in many data-driven apps. Instead of a spinner, this approach uses a large rectangular placeholder that appears to “shimmer” with a diagonal or horizontal gradient that sweeps across the box.

This creates the impression that something complex (like your visualization image) is being generated or processed behind the scenes. The box can mirror the shape of the eventual visualization (square, landscape, or portrait). Multiple shimmer bars or rectangles could also be used to imply layered rendering.

This effect is simple to implement using a div with a gradient background animated to shift from left to right. It feels polished and modern, and pairs well with the image-generation aspect of your project.

Use for: Loading the visualization generation step.
Vibe: Clean, professional, abstract, reflective of “rendering.”
Effort level: Very easy.


🌀 4. Abstract Shape Morphing (Visualization Loading)

An artistic loading animation where a single shape (or a few shapes) slowly morphs from one form into another — circle to square, square to triangle, triangle to blob, and so on. The transitions are smooth and organic, reflecting the creative and generative nature of your visualization engine.

This animation visually communicates the idea of “constructing” or “transforming” data into art. You can implement it using an SVG path with CSS keyframe animations or using a simpler technique like squishing/stretching a div into different border-radius patterns.

For an even more abstract look, you can animate multiple layered shapes with different speeds or opacities. Soft gradients or pastel colors work especially well for keeping the feel artistic and not mechanical.

Use for: Visualization loading (rendering the user’s chosen art form).
Vibe: Creative, fluid, artistic, generative.
Effort level: Easy → Medium depending on complexity.
